Title: **Quantum Physics and Algebraic Graph Theory**

Abstract: The possibility of a *quantum computer* has lead to much new work in theoretical physics and, naturally enough, this work has raised many new mathematical problems. What is perhaps surprising is that it has lead to interesting problems in algebraic *graph theory*. For example, questions about the relative power of quantum computer and classical computers lead to questions about the chromatic number of certain graphs. In my talk I will discuss some of these problems, and some of the progress that has been made.
