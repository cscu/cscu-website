The 2014 grad event will be held in the Thomas lounge on May 31st at 7pm! This event is for graduating computer science and math students and their guests. Inspired by the smalltalk curruiculum all compsci students love, we present an 80's themed party! Period attire is strictly optional, though awesome.

Early-bird tickets are free for grads!! A limited number of tickets may be available for guest price at the door, so please get your tickets early!

With your ticket you get:

Buffet-style dinner
Cash bar
Entry in a raffle for our mystery prize
All grads also get a special gift! (worth it!)

Thanks to everyone who filled in our survey! If you notice any of your fellow new grads who were not invited to this event, please invite them!
