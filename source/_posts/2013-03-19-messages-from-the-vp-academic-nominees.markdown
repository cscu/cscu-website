## Maryam Al-Harazi
Hello, my name is Maryam Al-Harazi. I am one of the ten girls in second year of computer science! I am running for VP Academic for the Computer Science Course Union. Just to give you a brief background about me, computer science will be my second undergrad degree. Prior to computer science, I completed my Bachelor of Business Administration from Brock University. At Brock I had the opportunity of working in one of the largest student groups as VP for one year then moving up to elected President for another year. It was an amazing experience where I was able to collaborate with students, faculty and staff. Currently at Ryerson I am the VP Academic for the Women in Computer Science student group.


As VP Academic for our course union I would be an executive officer of the course union, responsible for maintaining the CSCU Exam Bank and a voting member for the Department of Computer Science.


I am confident that I am the right candidate for this position as I have the skill set and experience. If anyone has any questions please come speak to me! Voting is open until Sunday, so please do vote! Thanks for your time!

## Dave Tenty
Hi everyone, my name is Dave and I wanted to give you a brief overview of some of the things I'd like to accomplish if elected VP academic for next school year.


* I would like to have more academic events such as guest speakers. I have had some experience organizing talks elsewhere on subjects such as new programming languages and open source software.
* I would also like to organize workshops on supplemental topics that students may find helpful, such as version control and build systems.
* I want to encourage an open dialogue with the department as your representative and look at the possibility of expanding study space available to CS students.


I have experience running events such as the Ubuntu Installfest this term and I look forward to putting together more events this fall.
Thanks for reading and I hope I have your support!
